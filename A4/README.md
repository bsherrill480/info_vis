I totally forgot to comment my code. Sorry.

For my line chart, I used https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245 as a starting point.

my my 2nd chart, I used http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084 and http://bl.ocks
.org/mbostock/3202354 as references.

## Questions

1) Column 1 is ordinal, since it's discrete years. Column 2 is also ordinal, since it's discrete
Congress sessions. Column 3 is quantitative, since it's a numeric metric.

2)

In the line chart, the marks are points (x and y values) and the channel is position.
Also for the line chart, I made sure to color the line a different color than the axis, since it
passes over the 0 axis.

For my chart, the marks are points (x values) and color (heat value). I picked blue for democrat and
red for republican, since those are the colors people commonly associate.

3)

The line chart is a pretty clear choice, since we have 2d ordinal data.

For my chart, I just kinda thought it would be more visually interesting. What you can do with my
chart, that
might be a little easier than with a line chart, is to identify grouped behaviour. e.g. overall for
a period which party was dominant.

4)

I see a few trends. from 1860-1930ish it was mostly republicans with the majority, from 1930ish to
1985ish it's been mostly democrats with the majority. after 1985 it's been back and forth.

Also, it looks like we're moving more and more towards closer smaller swings in majorities. I.e.
parties tend to have a smaller majority recently than they did in the past.

5) Compare and contrast teh two different charts

In my opinion, the line chart is better for displaying information. That said, I feel like
my chart is a little more fun since it's interactive and color coded. I think for identifying
trends, a line chart is much better, with my chart it's harder to identify because I'm using
color instead of position as a mark. That said, it is easier to make a blanket statement with my
chart about who was winning during a certain period.
